> A web editor to generate and validate `publiccode.yml` files

ðŸš§ This is the work in progress `develop` branch previewed at **https://publiccode-editor-develop.vercel.app** ðŸš§

Check out the [`master`](https://github.com/italia/publiccode-editor/tree/master) for the old version in production.

---

## Description

This app helps you create and validate a [`publiccode.yml`](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml) file for your project.
Simply fill out the form to generate a YAML file that meets the latest standards,
which you can then download or copy to your project's root directory.

You can also use the app to check and correct an existing `publiccode.yml` file.
Just upload the file to import it, and the app will validate and help fix any issues.
